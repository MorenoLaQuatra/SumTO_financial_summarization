- `summarize.py` contains the code to initialize and apply the model to pre-parsed input data collections.
- In `summarize.py`: `DATA_DIR` and `TEST_DIR` should be set according to your environment configuration
- In `summarize.py`: `YourSystemID` should be set according to your output folder (it will contain the summarized documents at the end of the summarization process)
